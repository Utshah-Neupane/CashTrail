For this project, I have accounts in these websites:
    https://dashboard.clerk.com  (for email-password authentication)
    https://utshah-neupane-s-team.postman.co (for api testing)
    https://console.neon.tech (for database)
    https://console.upstash.com/redis/ (for upstash rate limiting)



1. Backend Folder

    Creates package.json:
    npm init -y

    To install express:
    npm i express

    To change version of express from 5 to 4 because it is more stable:
    npm i express@4.21.0

    This then:
    npm i dotenv@16.5.0 cors@2.8.5  @neondatabase/serverless@1.0.0

    Then for bakend folder, to run, I did:
    node server.js

    So that we don't have to restart and kill terminal everytime
    npm i -D nodemon

    Installing the ratelimiting package:
    npm i @upstash/redis@1.34.9 @upstash/ratelimit@2.0.5

    Installing cron package because in render, server always down with 15 minutes of inactivity:
    npm i cron

    For running the program:
    npm run dev






2. Mobile folder

    Creating the template app:
    npx create-expo-app@latest .

    To reset the project
    npm run reset-project

    To generate react-native functional component
    rnfe

    For authentication using clerk:
    npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
    npm install expo-secure-store

    Keyboard avoiding/blocking view package:
    npm i react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view



    Then to run the app:
    npx expo




3. When I wrote code in hooks and index.jsx in mobile folder, then I deployed the backend in render,
        and then the deployed url is used instead of local host so that the data from database can be 
        fetched even in my physical device.
